    "For this lab, we will be using TensorFlow 2 to build and train a model to classify images, and specifically take advantage of the Keras API provided with TensorFlow to make that process really easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is an end-to-end, open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources. This lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Source: https://www.tensorflow.org/)_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Source: https://keras.io/)_\n",
    "\n",
    "__Or, to put it another way:__\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a complex and powerful tool, but Keras provides a high-level interface that allows us to rapidly prototype models without dealing with all of the complexity TensorFlow offers.\n",

    "# Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "We have bricks. Lots of bricks. LEGO bricks, that is. And we need to sort them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have a collection of photos of various LEGO bricks from different angles. We have 600 photos (which probably took us more time to collect than sorting the current bricks) and they are all labeled with the brick type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each photo has been processed. This involved increasing the contrast, sharpening, removing the color, inverting the colors, and reducing the size.\n",
    "\n",
    "|![Sample LEGO brick photo](./sample-before.png)|![Sample LEGO brick photo](./sample-after.png)|\n",
    "|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Sample before processing                | Sample after processing                |\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, we stored all the images into data arrays for easier loading into the notebook. These are stored in the `lego-simple-train-images.npy` and `lego-simple-test-images.npy` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to create a simple, deep learning, neural network classifier model. We will train the model using the photo data and see if it correctly predicts the type of a brick from a supplied test image."

To get the most from this lab, you should understand what the code in each cell is trying to accomplish, and then take the time to experiment: make changes, break it, fix it, and learn! You can always pull the code down again to get a clean copy."
